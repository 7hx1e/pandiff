# Lorem ipsum dolor amet

I really love _italic fonts_ here.

bc. print("Hello")
print("world.")
print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt")


Don't go around saying to people that the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first. One thing is impossible for God: To find sense in any copyright law on the planet. Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.
