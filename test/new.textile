I really love _italic font&#45;styles_ there.

bc. print("Hello")
print("world!")
print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt")


Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first. Only one thing is impossible for God: To find any sense in any copyright law on the planet. Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.
