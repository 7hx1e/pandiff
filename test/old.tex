I really love \emph{italic fonts} here.

\begin{verbatim}
print("Hello")
print("world.")
print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt")
\end{verbatim}

Don't go around saying to people that the world owes you a living. The
world owes you nothing. It was here first. One thing is impossible for
God: To find sense in any copyright law on the planet. Truth is stranger
than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to
possibilities; Truth isn't.
